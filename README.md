## How to

Use [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases) by replacing `binkw32.dll` and drop the compiled .asi in your game folder.

## Build

Make sure you have [premake5](https://premake.github.io/) installed and in your PATH then run
```
premake5 vs2019
```
Open the solution file and build the project. Make sure you have [MinHook.x86.lib](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/releases) and d3d9

Make sure to set TRAE, TR7 or TR8 preprocessor definition for the target game.

### How to load new objects?

First browse to the root of the disk where your game is installed, for example D:\

Add a folder D:\units here your will put the replacement or new .drm files \
If you are also adding new files copy the game's existing objectlist.txt to D:\TRAE\pc-w\objectlist.txt, higher the first number by one and add another line with your id and name.

**Note** objectlist.txt must always end with a line ending (empty line) else the game will crash on start.
