## How to

Use [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases) by replacing `binkw32.dll` and drop the compiled .asi in your game folder.

## Build

Make sure you have [premake5](https://premake.github.io/) installed and in your PATH then run
```
premake5 vs2019
```
Open the solution file and build the project. Make sure you have [MinHook.x86.lib](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook/releases) and d3d9

Make sure to set TRAE, TR7 or TR8 preprocessor definition for the target game.

## Todo

Other todo items can be found in the 'Projects' tab on GitHub

- Make use of patterns to support more executables like Steam
- Refactor a lot of code to use structs instead of offsets

## FAQ

### How to load files outside bigfile.000

Create a folder at the root of your disk \TRAE\units on which the game is installed for example D:\TRAE\units and add the files.

|Game         | Folder | Support                                        |
|-------------|--------|------------------------------------------------|
| Anniversary | \TRAE\ | .raw, .drm (units and objects), objectlist.txt |
| Legend      | \TR7\  | .raw, .drm (units and objects), objectlist.txt |
| Underworld  | \TR8\  | .drm (units and objects)                       |

Objects have to be defined in objectlist.txt to birth them ingame (see below), units don't and can always be loaded.

### How to load custom objectlist.txt

Use the same folder as above but instead of \units create a folder \pc-w and put your objectlist.txt inside, if it finds your objectlist.txt it will tell so in the Log window.

### How to add new objects

Start by adding the .drm file of your object to the units folder (see above), next open your objectlist.txt and add +1 to the number on the first line. Then scroll to the last line and add a new line
```
959,yourobjectwithoutdotdrm
```

**Note** objectlist.txt must always end with a line ending (empty line) else the game will crash on start.
